## Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, we aim to build a classification model to predict the likelihood of customer churn for a telecom company (Vodafone). Using Supervised Machine Learning, we will explore how churn analytics can help businesses proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, optimize retention efforts, and create strategies to enhance customer loyalty.

### Project Overview

Customer churn is a significant issue for subscription-based industries, and this predictive model provides a data-driven solution to address it. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, businesses can take steps to retain them before it's too late. The project follows the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to analyze customer churn within the Vodafone network.

## Model Performance ðŸ“Š

- **Accuracy Scores**: The trained models achieved an accuracy of around **86%** on the test data after hyperparameter tuning. Random Forest and other ensemble methods performed well, with ensemble methods showing superior results compared to single classifiers.
- **Key Features**: 
  - The number of months a customer has stayed with the company (tenure) and the contract type (contract) were found to be the most significant predictors of churn.
  - **Accuracy Score after Hyperparameter Tuning**: ~86%

## Dashboard ðŸ“º

An interactive **Power BI** dashboard is created to visualize the customer churn analysis. This dashboard allows users to explore the data and observe trends related to customer churn, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

1. **Enhance Early Customer Experience**:
   - Customers in their first 5-10 months show a higher churn rate, suggesting that improving onboarding processes and addressing customer concerns during this period will boost customer retention.

2. **Promote Long-Term Contracts**:
   - Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate. Encouraging customers to opt for one-year or two-year contracts could potentially reduce churn and foster customer loyalty.

3. **Model Insights**:
   - Ensemble methods, such as Random Forest, performed well in classification tasks, and hyperparameter tuning helped achieve a slight performance improvement.
   - Hyperparameter tuning doesnâ€™t always drastically improve model performance, but it does offer slight improvements when done correctly.
